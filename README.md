# go-pds

Experimental Go package implementing an ATProto Personal Data Server (pds).

## Motivation

This is experimental work to implement a "minimal viable" ATProto Personal Data Server (pds) such that SFO Museum can create accounts for things in its collection and participate on/with the ATProto network (read: Bluesky).
